# 知识整理工作流：Discovery

Loaded by states: `PARSE_SCOPE`, `INVENTORY`.

This file owns target parsing, scope clarification, resource inventory, ResourceItem normalization, dedupe, and partial inventory handling. It MUST NOT generate classification rules, execution plans, or perform write operations.

## Required Context

Before executing rules in this file:

1. For Wiki / personal library targets, follow [`../../lark-wiki/SKILL.md`](../../lark-wiki/SKILL.md).
2. For Drive search targets, follow [`lark-drive-search.md`](lark-drive-search.md).
3. For URL / token inspection, follow [`lark-drive-inspect.md`](lark-drive-inspect.md) and [`../../lark-wiki/references/lark-wiki-node-get.md`](../../lark-wiki/references/lark-wiki-node-get.md).

## State: PARSE_SCOPE

Entry: workflow triggered.

MUST:

1. Identify `target_scope`, `environment_profile`, and `identity`.
2. Apply `Scope Parsing`.
3. Output `Scope Confirmation`.
4. Stop and wait for user confirmation before `INVENTORY`.

Exit: user confirms target scope.

### Scope Parsing

| Condition | Agent MUST Do | Set `target_scope` | Next State |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|------------|
| Input is `/wiki/<token>` URL | Resolve the Wiki node and preserve both node identity and object identity | Wiki node | `INVENTORY` after user confirms scope |
| Input is Wiki space name / `space_id` | Resolve the Wiki space; 0 matches -> stop and ask; 1 exact match -> continue; multiple matches -> show candidates and wait for user selection; do not treat `my_library` as a normal listed space | Wiki space | `INVENTORY` after user confirms scope |
| Input has Personal Library Intent | Treat as Wiki personal library / `my_library`; resolve real `space_id` before root write; do not treat it as Drive root or owned Drive document search | Personal doc library | `INVENTORY` after user confirms scope |
| Input is `/drive/folder/<token>` URL | Extract `folder_token` | Drive folder | `INVENTORY` after user confirms scope |
| Input has Drive Folder Intent but no concrete folder URL, token, or unique folder name | Ask for folder URL / token / name; if a concrete folder name exists, search folder candidates and wait for user selection when 0 or multiple matches exist | Unknown or Drive folder candidate | Stay in `PARSE_SCOPE` until scope is confirmed |
| Input has Broad Cloud Drive Intent without explicit owned-document search request | Ask the user to choose concrete scope: Drive folder URL / token, Drive root, owned Drive document search, or another explicit search filter; do not default to `drive +search --mine` | Unknown | Stay in `PARSE_SCOPE` until scope is confirmed |
| Input is single cloud resource URL | Resolve the resource type; if not folder / Wiki scope, do not expand automatically | Single resource | Ask whether scope is this resource, parent folder, owning Wiki, or related search results |
| Input is real keyword / name | Search with the real keyword according to `lark-drive-search` | Search scope | `INVENTORY` after user confirms scope |
| Input is range browsing / statistical description with no real keyword | Search by filters / empty-query browsing according to `lark-drive-search` | Search scope | `INVENTORY` after user confirms scope |
| Input is ambiguous | Ask the minimum clarification question and stop | Unknown | Stay in `PARSE_SCOPE` |

Personal Library Intent means the user is referring to the current user's own Feishu document library / personal document library / personal knowledge library, such as `个人文档库`, `飞书个人文档库`, `我的文档库`, `个人知识库`, `我的知识库`, `My Document Library`, or `my_library`.

When this intent is detected, use Wiki personal library semantics. Do not use Drive root, `drive +search --mine`, or broad owned-document search unless the user explicitly asks to search owned Drive documents.

Drive Folder Intent means the user wants to organize a specific Drive folder or Drive folder tree. A Drive folder scope requires a concrete folder URL, folder token, or user-selected folder candidate.

When this intent is detected without a concrete folder identity, stop in `PARSE_SCOPE` and ask for clarification. Do not use Drive root, `drive +search --mine`, or broad owned-document search unless the user explicitly asks for Drive root or owned-document search.

Broad Cloud Drive Intent means the user refers to a broad cloud-drive-level scope such as `我的飞书云盘`, `我的云盘`, `我的云空间`, `我的空间`, or `整理云盘`, without a concrete folder URL / token / unique folder name.

This intent is broader than Drive Folder Intent and MUST NOT be silently converted to owned-document search. Ask the user to choose one of:

1. A specific Drive folder URL / token.
2. Drive root, only when the user explicitly accepts root-level scope.
3. Owned Drive document search, only when the user explicitly asks to organize documents owned / managed by the current user.
4. Another explicit search filter, such as keyword, type, time range, or folder token.

### Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for clarification when:

1. 用户只说"整理文件夹"、"整理目录"、"整理资料"、"整理文档"、"我的文档"，且没有 URL、token、知识库名称、Personal Library Intent、concrete Drive folder identity 或明确搜索范围。
2. 用户说"我的文件夹"、"我的目录"、"我的空间"、"我的云盘"、"我的飞书云盘"、"我的云空间"，但无法唯一判断是具体 Drive 文件夹、Drive 根目录、owned Drive document search、个人文档库还是某个 Wiki 节点。
3. 用户给的是单个资源 URL，但要求"整理一批文档"或"整理相关资料"。
4. 用户目标环境不明确，且上下文中同时存在线上、BOE、PRE 或多个 profile。

Clarification template:

```text
请提供要整理的 Drive 文件夹链接、Wiki 节点 / 知识库链接，或明确说明要整理"我的文档库"；如果只想按关键词搜索整理，也请给出关键词或范围。
```

### Scope Confirmation

```text
我先确认本次整理范围。

目标：
范围：
环境 / profile：
身份：
预计操作：先盘点并生成整理方案，不执行移动或创建。

请确认是否按这个范围继续？
```

## State: INVENTORY

Entry: `target_scope` confirmed.

MUST:

1. Recursively list resources according to target type.
2. Generate `path` during traversal.
3. Normalize all results to `ResourceItem`.
4. Track pagination, depth, and item limits.
5. Set `partial=true` when limits are hit.
6. Output `Inventory Summary`.
7. Continue to `CONTENT_READ` without asking the user unless auth, permission, API, target scope, or environment blockers occur.

### Inventory Limits

| Scope | Default Limit | If Limit Is Hit |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Wiki recursion | `max_depth=3`, `max_items=500`; follow `lark-wiki-node-list` pagination | Set `partial=true`; list covered paths and suggested next first-level directories |
| Drive folder recursion | `max_depth=3`, `max_items=500`, max 10 pages per folder, `page_size=50` | Set `partial=true`; list folders not drilled into |
| Search discovery | `page_size=20`, `max_items=500`; continue pages until `has_more=false` or `max_items` is reached | Set `partial=true`; report collected_count, service_total when available, page_count, and continuation information |

If the user explicitly asks for full processing, batch by first-level directory, Wiki space, or time window. Do not remove all limits in one run.

### Wiki Inventory Rules

1. Follow [`../../lark-wiki/references/lark-wiki-node-list.md`](../../lark-wiki/references/lark-wiki-node-list.md) traversal semantics.
2. Generate stable paths from parent-child traversal.
3. Preserve Wiki node identity fields needed by `ResourceItem`.
4. Treat `my_library` as Wiki personal library, not Drive root.

### Drive Inventory Rules

1. Use CLI command family `drive files list` according to `lark-drive` API rules; its schema path is `drive.files.list`.
2. Recurse only into `folder` items.
3. Use `drive metas batch_query` when URL, owner, created time, or updated time is needed.
4. Continue pages by feeding `next_page_token` into request param `page_token`.
5. Prefer explicit `folder_token`; querying root with empty `folder_token` may return broad root data and may not paginate as expected.

### Search Inventory Rules

1. Search results may be normalized directly only when they include stable identity fields required by `ResourceItem`.
2. If a search result is a Wiki item and lacks `node_token`, resolve it with `drive +inspect` or `wiki +node-get` before dedupe.
3. If Wiki identity still cannot be resolved, keep the item, set `needs_review=true`, and record `needs_review_reason`.
4. For search scope, use `page_size=20` unless a lower value is required by the command.
5. Continue fetching pages until `has_more=false` or `max_items` is reached.
6. Do not stop at an arbitrary sample size such as first 5 pages unless the user explicitly asks for sampling or auth, permission, API, environment, or tool-budget blockers occur.
7. If `service_total` / result total is greater than collected items, set `partial=true` and show collected_count, service_total, page_count, and continuation information.
8. Do not present a partial search sample as complete inventory. Before generating a full organization plan from partial search results, ask whether to continue fetching more pages or proceed with sample-based planning.

## ResourceItem

Agent MUST normalize Wiki, Drive, and search results into `ResourceItem`. Later statistics, classification, and planning MUST use this model rather than raw API responses.

```json
{
  "source": "wiki|drive|search",
  "title": "资源标题",
  "type": "doc|docx|sheet|bitable|mindnote|file|wiki|folder|slides|shortcut|catalog",
  "path": "当前路径/资源标题",
  "depth": 2,
  "url": "https://...",
  "token": "canonical_token",
  "node_token": "wiki_node_token_or_empty",
  "obj_token": "wiki_obj_token_or_drive_file_token",
  "node_type": "origin|shortcut|empty",
  "origin_node_token": "wiki_origin_node_token_or_empty",
  "space_id": "wiki_space_id_or_empty",
  "parent_token": "parent_node_or_folder_token",
  "has_child": false,
  "dedupe_key": "wiki:<space_id>:<node_token>|drive:<type>:<token>|search:<type>:<token>",
  "created_at": "optional",
  "updated_at": "optional",
  "needs_review": false,
  "needs_review_reason": ""
}
```

ResourceItem rules:

1. `path` MUST be generated by recursion. Do not use title alone as path.
2. Wiki URL token may not be the underlying document token. Preserve both `node_token` and `obj_token`.
3. `type` MUST come from API fields such as `obj_type` / `doc_type`.
4. Wiki organization is by node instance. Prefer `wiki:<space_id>:<node_token>` as `dedupe_key`.
5. MUST NOT dedupe Wiki nodes only by `obj_token`; one document can appear under different Wiki paths or shortcuts.
6. If `node_type=shortcut` or dedupe is uncertain, use `wiki +node-get` to supplement `origin_node_token`; if unavailable, leave empty and set `needs_review=true`.
7. Drive folder tree dedupes by `drive:<type>:<token>`.
8. Search results may merge with recursive results only by exact identity: Wiki by same `node_token`, Drive by same `type + token`.

## Discovery Failure Handling

| Failure / Blocker | Agent MUST Do | Agent MUST NOT Do |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Target scope is ambiguous | Ask the minimum scope clarification question and stop | Do not choose a whole cloud drive / personal library by default |
| Environment / profile is ambiguous | Ask user to confirm prod / BOE / PRE and profile | Do not cross environment boundaries |
| Missing API scope | Follow the `console_url` in the error response to guide the user, then stop | Do not retry the same command repeatedly |
| Resource access denied | Stop and follow the main workflow `Permission Request Gate` | Do not request permission automatically or in batch |
| Pagination / depth / item limit reached | Set `partial=true`; record uncovered range and continuation command | Do not claim full coverage |
